Write a genetic algorithm program 
(use binary encoding, 1-pont crossover, fitness proportionate selection and bit mutation) 
to maximize the function f(x) = x^2 for x= 0..63 and
show the results in a graph (max, avg & min)running for 50 generations and until the population
converges. Take an initial random population of size 20, include all assumptions you made in
your implementation.

Solution:
Find the codes in
Chromosome.java
GA_Operator.java
MainProgram.java
Population.java
