Write a genetic algorithm program (use binary encoding, 1-pont crossover, fitness
proportionate selection and bit mutation) to maximize the function f(x) = x^2 for x= 0..63 and
show the results in a graph (max, avg & min)running for 50 generations and until the population
converges. Take an initial random population of size 20, include all assumptions you made in
your implementation.
